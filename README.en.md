This project is a simple bank implementation inspired by [spring-ddd-bank](https://github.com/christophknabe/spring-ddd-bank) and [internet-banking-concept-microservices](https://github.com/JavatoDev-com/internet-banking-concept-microservices).
The following major improvements are applied:
- JDK 11 to 17 - Runtime improvements and Spring Boot 3 support
- Java to Kotlin - Reduce NPEs and write concise code
- Spring Boot 2 to 3 - Framework update
- Spring Reactive - Improved resource usage through asynchronous processing
- Modular Monolith - Makes robust DDD structure and keep structure that can refactor to MSA easily
